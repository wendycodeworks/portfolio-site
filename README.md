## Purpose

Websites can showcase a coder's experience as well as aptitude. As with any portfolio, projects are essential to demonstrate skill and provide an alternative to a GitHub repository. 

This portfolio website works to simplify the message, focusing on succinct communication without compromising too much detail about the coder. While this is intended to be a professional website, I wanted to inject some playfulness and a little personality into the design. I also wanted to draw attention to important information, without bombarding the visitor with excessive colours and graphics. The essentialist approach to the design is also a reflection with how I work and what the visitor can anticipate from me when they engage my services.

## Features

### 1. Navigation

Navigation has been kept simple and intuitive with a horizontal navigation bar in the header. The labels are conventional, with the exception of the 'about me' page which is labelled "What I do". 

### 2. Footer

### 3. Blog and project cards

### 4. Resume download

### Responsive web design

The website can be viewed on a mobile device without distortion of the components and elements. A combination of flexbox and media queries makes it possible to view the website on various mobile screen sizes. Viewing the website on a tablet device will display the web page.

### Semantic HTML

### Subresource integrity (SRI)

The website makes use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for fonts and icons. Using CDNs does come at a risk. Malicious content can be injected into a CDN in the case of an attack. Applying SRI adds a basic layer of security.
