## Purpose

Websites can showcase a coder's experience as well as aptitude. As with any portfolio, projects are essential to demonstrate skill and provide an alternative to a GitHub repository. 

This portfolio website works to simplify the message, focusing on succinct communication without compromising too much detail about the coder. While this is intended to be a professional website, I wanted to inject some playfulness and a little personality into the design. I also wanted to draw attention to important information, without bombarding the visitor with excessive colours and graphics. The essentialist approach to the design is also a reflection with how I work and what the visitor can anticipate from me when they engage my services.
